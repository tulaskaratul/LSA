1. Install samba package
  sudo apt update	
  sudo apt install samba

2. Make a directory for Sharing (here: sambashare)
  mkdir <path>/sambashare/

3. Editing the config file
  sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
  
4. Insert the following at the end of the config file and then hit Ctrl + O and Ctrl + X
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
    
5. Restarting the samba service
  sudo service smbd restart
 
6. Allowing ufw to allow requests
  sudo ufw allow samba
  
7. Now we'll set up a samba password for the user
  sudo smbpasswd -a username
